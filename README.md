How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Over the course of this class I've learned a lot about automation in the SDLC, and how it is implemented. While learning how to write clean
and easy to read code is something that I've learned and am still working on over the years, the addition of automation in my programs causes me to be extra careful
with how I approach development; That being said I try to ensure that my code is thoroughly tested via unit tests or static testing and reviewed for any possible errors before publishing or sumbitting.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
My usual plan before I start any sort of coding is to take account and plan any requirements that I need to accomplish first, and plan it all out in either pseudo code or flowchart ensuring
I incorporate requirements and needs into my program before even beginning.

How do I approach designing software?
As previously stated I plan out my approach before beginning, obviously things change during the proccess, but with a well planned outline of what is required I can stay on task and revise my plan if
it comes down to it. Since I would consider myself somewhat of a beginner, there are times where I discover a better way to implement a system and pivot from my initial design as well.
